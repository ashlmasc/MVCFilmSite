# MVCFilmSite Project

The MVCFilmSite project is an advanced Java web application that enables users to interact with a film database through a web interface. This project leverages the Spring MVC framework, demonstrating the integration of Java with a MySQL database and web technologies. It showcases the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a web application, offering an intuitive user experience while interacting with film data.

## Description
MVCFilmSite is a web-based application developed using the Spring MVC framework. It allows users to interact with a film database, providing functionalities such as viewing, adding, updating, and deleting film records.

**Key Features:**

- **View Film Details by ID:** Users can enter a film's ID to view detailed information about the film in a web page.
- **Add New Film:** This feature allows users to add new films to the database by entering film properties like title, description, release year, and more.
- **Edit Existing Film:** Users can retrieve a film and edit its details, including all properties except the film's ID.
- **Delete Film:** Users can delete a film from the database. The application handles deletion failures, such as when a film has child records in other tables.
- **Search Films by Keyword:** The application offers a search functionality where users can find films based on keywords in the title or description.
- **Film Details Display:** The application shows detailed information about films, including actors and categories associated with the film.

This project is a comprehensive example of building a web application using the Spring MVC framework. It demonstrates the handling of web requests, interaction with a MySQL database, and rendering data in a user-friendly web interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The primary programming language used for developing the application.
- **Spring MVC Framework:** Utilized for creating a model-view-controller architecture, facilitating web request handling and response.
- **MySQL:** Database system used for storing and managing film data.
- **JDBC API:** Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API for connecting the Java application with the MySQL database.
- **HTML/CSS:** Used for creating and styling web pages.
- **JSP:** JavaServer Pages for dynamic content generation in web pages.
- **Gradle:** Used for project management and build automation. This tool simplifies the build process, manages dependencies, and integrates seamlessly with the Spring MVC framework.
- **Git/GitHub:** Used for version control and source code management.
- **Spring Tool Suite 4:** An IDE specifically tailored for development with the Spring framework, enhancing productivity and providing integrated tools for Spring-based applications.
